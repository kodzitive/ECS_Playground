# ECS Playground

Currently the only experiment here is a voxel-ish fire simulation.

Here are some examples of what it looks like running!

## Setup and configuration

This is built using Unity 2020.1b15, as that version has a lot of important fixes for ECS and the hybrid renderer V2.

To configure the simulation, play with some of these parameters and see what happens
